# what network it's part of

# a subnet mask when broken down to binary
# means a 1 in subnet mask is part of thenetworking 
# portion
# how many bits reperstnet a network address and how much
#   - is a host address

# so subnet mask 
# number of combinations can be number of networks
# 
#how many bits are decicated to the network portian

# broodcast 255
# first all 0 in host 
# network address, broadcast address
# network address is all 111
# every network has a network and has a boardcast 

# dns server = address that is given to you
     
# unicast - send packet from one host to an individual hos

# Broadcast - send packet one host to all in the network

# multicat send a packet from one to selected group

# class of address is dermintied by the value of the first octet
# A  0 - 127.0.0.0                16,777,214 address block
# B  128.0.0.0 - 191.255.0.0      64,534

# 8 hextext 

# first 3 hextexts represent network portian
# last 5 are for host

# gloabal routing prefix is first 3 hextexts
# 4t

# isp uses 48 bits
# subnet what you had
# 4 hextext you can make it up

# we use 64

48 bits global Routing Prefix, first 3 are same for entire network
16 bits subnet ids
64 bits Interface ID
